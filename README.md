## About

Amoebas are a family of simple graphs first defined by Adriana Hansberg, Yair Caro and Amanda Montejano, who initially studied them in the context of Ramsey-Turán Theory [1, 2]. The study of these graphs is of interest, in particular, due to its relation with the graph isomorphism problem. All the programs here can be used to detect amoebas and analyze their properties. This repository was developed as part of the work of Marcos E. González Laffitte's Master Thesis in Mathematics under supervision of Dra. Amanda Montejano Cantoral.<br/>
