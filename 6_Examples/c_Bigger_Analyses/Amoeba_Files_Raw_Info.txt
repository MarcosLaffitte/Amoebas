The graphs in *raw.pkl files are stored with python pickle package, inside a list of tupples of the form:

> Amoeba Graphs
  eachAmoeba = (Order, Size, Connected_Or_Not, Amoeba_Family, G6name)
  where,
  - Order is int type holding the number of vertices
  - Size is int type holding the number of edges
  - Connected_Or_Not is string type with values: "conexa" meaning connected or "disconexa" meaning disconnected
  - Amoeba_Family is string type with values: "local" meaning only LA, "global" meaning only GA or "ambas" meaning LAnGA
  - G6name is string type holding the g6 format of the graph 

> Amoeba Trees
  eachAmoeba = (Order, Size, "conexa", Amoeba_Family, G6name)
  where,
  - Order is int type holding the number of vertices
  - Size is int type holding the number of edges
  - Amoeba_Family is string type with values: "LA" meaning LAnGA or "GA" meaning only GA
  - G6name is string type holding the g6 format of the graph 

> Weird Graphs
  eachGraph = (Order, Size, Connected_Or_Not, Amoeba_Family, Replacements, G6name)
  where,
  - Order is int type holding the number of vertices
  - Size is int type holding the number of edges
  - Connected_Or_Not is string type with values: "conexa" meaning connected or "disconexa" meaning disconnected
  - Amoeba_Family is string type with values: "LA" meaning only LA, "GA" meaning only GA, "LAnGA" meaning LAnGA or "NO" meaning not amoeba
  - Replacements is a list containing two lists [Ordinary_Replacements, Weird_Replacements], both containing edge-replacements
    as tupples of integers (r, s, k, l) for each replacement rs -> kl of the graph
  - G6name is string type holding the g6 format of the graph 

***NOTE***

The labels LA and GA in these files differ from the column-labels LA and GA in the tables in the PDF files, since the LA in the tables means
"local amoeba that may or may not be also global amoeba", and the same for GA.
